# Portfolio & Resume Workshop
A portfolio and resume workshop with HTML5UP and deployed on Azure

## Requirements

1. Download the zip folder containing all of the sample code that you'll need over here: [Sample Code](https://download.com/files.zip)
2. Make sure you have a text editor for code like VSCode, Atom, or Sublime. My recommended is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Getting an Azure account. Please follow this link, it will only work for 1 hour. [Azure Pass Claim](https://getazure.com)
4. You will need an application called FileZilla over here: [FileZilla Download](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)

## Setup Code

### Step 1: Open the sample code
1. Extract the folder from the zip file. It should be called `EtherealMSP`.
2. Go into the folder and open up `index.html` with your web browser. You can do this by right clicking it and selecting `Open With`, and choosing your web browser of choice. It should look something like this ![Screenshot of sample](https://i.imgur.com/xGG5Sp5.png)
3. If it does NOT look like the above, something is wrong. Please check the FAQ on common errors, ask a Student Partner, or even your neighbor for help!

### Step 2: Using your text editor
1. Open up your text editor of choice. In my case, I'll be using VSCode.
2. Click on `File` in the top left corner and select `Open`. Browse and locate your `index.html` file.
3. Your editor should now be displaying all of the HTML for the project! ![Editor setup](https://i.imgur.com/KcUmryR.png)


## Part 2: Setting up Azure

### Activate Your Azure Pass
This can be done following the instructions [here](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo). It will take around 5 minutes to complete.

### Create Your Web App

## FAQ

### My sample code looks like plain text without styles. ![No CSS](https://i.imgur.com/quEuYDs.png)
If it looks like this, you must've not extracted/uploaded the files properly. Please check your folder and file structure again.
