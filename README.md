## Setup Code

### Step 1: Open the sample code
1. Extract the folder from the zip file. It should be called `EtherealMSP`.
2. Go into the folder and open up `index.html` with your web browser. You can do this by right clicking it and selecting `Open With`, and choosing your web browser of choice. It should look something like this ![Screenshot of sample](https://i.imgur.com/xGG5Sp5.png)
3. If it does NOT look like the above, something is wrong. Please check the FAQ on common errors, ask a Student Partner, or even your neighbor for help!

### Step 2: Using your text editor
1. Open up your text editor of choice. In my case, I'll be using VSCode.
2. Click on `File` in the top left corner and select `Open`. Browse and locate your `index.html` file.
3. Your editor should now be displaying all of the HTML for the project! ![Editor setup](https://i.imgur.com/KcUmryR.png)

### Step 3: Editing the basic website info
1. Locate the text between the `<title>` tags, on line 7. This is the title of your website that will show up in the tab and for search engines. Change it to your name. ![Title](https://i.imgur.com/WmlYffT.png)
2. If you refresh the page now, it should have the title updated! CHANGE TO EDGE. ![Tab title](https://i.imgur.com/nkhDgBt.png)
3. Start scrolling down through the code until you see the section with social media. Change these links to your own. If you don't have them, just delete the line. ![Social media](https://i.imgur.com/azwbLxZ.png)
3. At the bottom of the page, change the word `Untitled` to your name as well. ![Copyright change](https://i.imgur.com/M7xuEuE.png)

### Step 4: Adding Bio info
1. Scrolling down a bit more to line
## Part 2: Setting up Azure

This can be done following the instructions [here](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo). It will take around 5 minutes to complete.

### Create Your Web App

## FAQ

### 1. My sample code looks like plain text without styles. ![No CSS](https://i.imgur.com/quEuYDs.png)
If it looks like this, you must've not extracted/uploaded the files properly. Please check your folder and file structure again.
